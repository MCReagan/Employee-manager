## Description


This project was created as a command-line interface application that allows storage of employee information inside a mysql database on your local machine. It uses an easy to navigate list to access options such as view employees, view roles, or view departments. Additionally, you may add a new employee, add a new role, add a new department, or update an existing employee's role. It uses javascript along with node, npm, inquire, and mysql2 modules. The most difficult aspect of the project was learning the idea of promises and resolves, but with sheer repitition, it makes a lot more sense now. In the future, I would like to be able to have more options such as view financial information by department or view employees by name.

## Contributing


Application was written primarily by Michael Reagan. My tutor, Omar, helped with understanding and creating working promises to ensure the functions were allowed to return a value before moving on. ChatGPT was used as a tool for debugging errors and inconsistencies in the code. Module documentation was referenced often.
